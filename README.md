# ASL Fingerspelling Classification with RBGL Model

Welcome to the ASL Fingerspelling Classification project repository! In this proposal, we outline the design and implementation of an RBGL (Research, Build, Generalize, and Learn) model for American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling classification. The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that lays the groundwork for future development on models that can train and run on edge devices.

## Introduction

Sign language is a crucial form of communication for many individuals, and fingerspelling is an essential component of American Sign Language (ASL). This project aims to build a deep learning model capable of classifying ASL fingerspelling gestures. The RBGL model, representing Research, Build, Generalize, and Learn, provides a systematic approach to model development and ensures that it can be extended to various applications, including edge device deployment.

## Project Overview

- **Research (R)**: We explore the existing literature and datasets related to ASL fingerspelling and deep learning. This phase involves gathering knowledge and insights to inform our model design.

- **Build (B)**: We create the deep learning model using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture, data preprocessing steps, and training process are documented in our Jupyter Notebook.

- **Generalize (G)**: The model's performance and generalization capabilities are assessed using validation and test datasets. We analyze the results and fine-tune the model as needed.

- **Learn (L)**: This project's findings and the RBGL model serve as a foundation for future research and development. We aim to facilitate the deployment of ASL fingerspelling classification models on edge devices to enhance accessibility.
